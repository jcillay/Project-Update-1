<h5> <b>Software To Use </b> </h5>
  <p> 
  We will be using any software provided by professor Clark and/or writing from scratch as well as PyTorch, Unreal Engine, and Open AI Gym.

<p> 
  The dataset we will be using will be provided by professor Clark or we will create our own. The type of neural network we will be using is deep reinforcement learning. This will be used to have our agent solve the maze. Our inputs will be the view of our agent to see a virtual maze in order to solve it, i.e. reaching a goal state. Our output will be a series of directions required for one agent to reach a specific goal state
