<h5> <b>Software To Use </b> </h5>
  <p> 
  We will be using any software provided by professor Clark and/or writing from scratch. We will also be using the toolkit OpenAI Gym with the numerical computation library of either TensorFlow or Theano and any environments we might choose to use in the Gym.
  </p>
<p> 
  The dataset we will be using will be provided by Professor Clark, or we will create our own. The type of neural network we will be using is deep reinforcement learning. This will be used to have our agent solve the maze. Our inputs will be the randomized virtual maze in which our agent has to solve, i.e. reaching a goal state. Our output will be a series of directions required for one agent to reach a specific goal state.
